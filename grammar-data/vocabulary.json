You can, however, declare what something is by attaching the Hiragana character   「だ」   to a noun or na-adjective   only .

We can conjugate a noun or adjective to either its negative or past tense to say that something is   not   [X] or that something   was   [X]. This may be a bit hard to grasp at first but none of these state-of-being conjugations make anything declarative like   「だ」   does. We'll learn how to make these tenses declarative by attaching   「だ」   to the end of the sentence in a later lesson. First, for the negative, attach   「じゃない」   to the noun or na-adjective. . . • Attach   「じゃない」   to the noun or na-adjective Example:   学⽣＋じゃない＝学⽣じゃない .

Let's say a person says, \"Not student.\" This is a perfectly valid sentence in Japanese but it doesn't tell us much without knowing what the person is talking about. The topic particle will allow us to express what our sentences are about. The topic particle is the character   「は」 . Now, while this character is normally pronounced as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle. 33",

What if I wanted to ask,   “ Who is the student? ” What I need is some kind of identifier because I don't know who the student is. If I use the topic particle, the question would become,   “ Is who the student? ” and that doesn't make any sense because \"who\" is not an actual person. This is where the   「が」   particle comes into play. It is also referred to as the subject particle but I hate that name since \"subject\" means something completely different in English grammar. Instead, I call it the   identifier particle   because the particle indicates that the speaker wants to identify something unspecified.  Example 1  ボブ：誰が学⽣？  Bob: Who is the one that is student?  アリス：ジョンが学⽣。  Alice: John is the one who is student. Bob wants to identify who among all the possible candidates is a student. Alice responds that John is the one. Notice, Alice could also have answered with the topic particle to indicate that, speaking of John, she knows that he is   a   student (maybe not   the   student).   You can see the difference in the next example. 36",

Since we have not yet learned how to create more than one clause, for now it means that any sentence with a verb must end with the verb. We will now learn the three main categories of verbs, which will allow us to define conjugation rules.   Before learning about verbs, there is one important thing to keep in mind. . . A grammatically complete sentence requires a verb only (including state-of-being). . Note Or to rephrase, unlike English, the only thing you need to make a grammatically complete sentence is a verb and nothing else! That's why even the simplest, most basic Japanese sentence cannot be translated into English! A grammatically complete sentence: •   ⾷べる。  Eat.

But before we get into that, we need to cover one very important exception to the negative conjugation rules:   「ある」 . •   ある   (u-verb) - to exist (inanimate) •   いる   (ru-verb) - to exist (animate)  「ある」   is an u-verb used to express existence of inanimate objects. The equivalent verb for animate objects (such as people or animals) is   「いる」 , which is a normal ru-verb. For example, if you wanted to say that a chair is in the room, you would use the verb   「ある」 , but if you wanted to say that a   person  is in the room, you must use the verb   「いる」   instead. These two verbs   「ある」   and   「いる」   are quite different from all other verbs because they describe existence and are not actual actions. You also need to be careful to choose the correct one based on animate or inanimate objects. Anyway, the reason I bring it up here is because the negative of   「ある」   is   「ない」   (meaning that something does not exist). The conjugation rules for all other verbs are listed below as well as a list of example verbs and their negative forms.  ＊   = exceptions particular to this conjugation  48",

It also does not guarantee whether the target is the final intended destination, only that one is heading towards that direction. In other words, the   「に」   particle sticks to the destination while the   「へ」   particle is fuzzy about where one is ultimately headed.

When we learn compound sentences, we will see that each sub-sentence of the compound sentence can end in masu-form as well. To conjugate verbs into the masu-form, you attach different conjugations of 「ます」 to the stem depending on the tense. Here is a chart.

You can also do this for substituted nouns (both   「の」   and   「ん」 ) by just treating them like regular nouns. Another important thing to remember is that if there is a declarative   「だ」 , it must be removed. In being polite, I guess you can't be so bold as to forwardly declare things the way  「だ」   does. Just like the masu-form, this must also go at the end of a complete sentence. Here is a chart illustrating the conjugations.  88",

However, I want to point some several key differences here and the reasons why they are in fact completely different things.   It is impossible to fully explain the reasons why they are fundamentally different without discussing grammar that have yet to be covered so I would like to target this toward those who have already started learning Japanese and have been incorrectly misinformed that   「だ」   is the casual version of   「です」 . For the rest of you new to this, you can easily skip this part. I'm sure most of you have learned the expression   「そう」   by now. Now, there are four ways to make a complete sentence using the state-of-being with   「そう」   to produce a sentence that says, \"That is so.\"  Different ways to say, \"That is so.\"",

I hope that the examples with Bob, Alice, and Jim have shown that people refer to other people by their names even when they are directly addressing that person.   Another common way to address people is by their title such as  「社⻑」 、 「課⻑」 、 「先⽣」   , etc. The word   「先⽣」   is used to generally mean any person who has significant knowledge and expertise in something. For example, people usually use   「先⽣」   when directly addressing doctors or teachers (obviously). You can also include the person's last name such as   「⽥中先⽣」   (teacher Tanaka). In the case where your relationship with the person doesn't involve any title, you can use their name (usually their last name) attached with   「さん」   to show politeness. If calling them by their last name seems a little too polite and distant, the practice of attaching   「さん」   to their first name also exists. More endearing and colloquial versions of   「さん」   include   「くん」   and  「ちゃん」 .   「くん」   is usually attached to the name of males who are of equal or lower social position. (For example, my boss sometimes calls me   「キムくん」 ).   「ちゃん」   is a very endearing way to refer to usually females of equal or lower social position.",

For the purpose of brevity, (since this   is   a grammar guide and not a vocabulary guide) we will only go over the immediate family.   In Japanese, you refer to members of other people's family more politely than your own. This is only when you are talking about members of your own family to others outside the family. For example, you would refer to your own mother as   「⺟」   to people outside your family but you might very well call her   「お⺟さん」   at home within your own family. There is also a distinction between older and younger siblings. The following chart list some of the most common terms for family members. There may also be other possibilities not covered in this chart.  95",

It is very similar to the   「や」   particle except that it lists reasons for verbs and state-of-being. Again, for states of being,   「だ」   must be used to explicitly declare the state-of-being for any non-conjugated noun or na-adjective. Let's look at some examples.  Example 1  Ａ：どうして友達じゃないんですか？  A: Why isn't (he/she) friend [seeking explanation]?  Ｂ：先⽣だし、年上だし・ ・ ・ 。  B: Well, he's/she's the teacher, and older...  Example 2  Ａ：どうして彼が好きなの？  A: Why (do you) like him?  Ｂ：優しいし、かっこいいし、⾯⽩いから。  B: Because he's kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things). Notice that   「優しくて、 かっこよくて、 ⾯⽩いから。 」   could also have worked but much like the difference between the   「と」   and   「や」   particle,   「し」   implies that there may be other reasons.  112",

    "meaning": "class This is the verb version of the   「や」   particle. You can make an example list of verbs among a possible larger list by conjugating each verb into the past tense and adding   「り」 . At the end, you need to attach the verb   「する」 . Just like the   「や」   particle, the tense is determined by the last verb, which in this case will always be   「する」   (since you have to attach it at the end). You can also use this with the state-of-being to say that you are a number of things at various random times among a larger list. Similar to regular verbs, you just take the noun or adjective for each state-of- being and conjugate it to the past state-of-being and then attach   「り」 . Then finally, attach   「する」   at the end. . . •   For verbs:   Conjugate each verb to the past tense and add   「り」 . Finally, add   「する」   at the very end. Example  ⾷べる、飲む   →   ⾷べた、飲んだ   →   ⾷べたり、飲んだり   →   ⾷べたり、飲んだりする  •   For state-of-being:   Conjugate the noun or adjective for each state-of-being to the past tense and add   「り」 . Finally, add   「する」   at the very end. Example  簡単、難しい   →   簡単だった、難しかった   →   簡単だったり、難しかったり   →   簡単だったり、難 しかったりする  . Rules for stating a list of verbs among a larger list using   「〜たりする」  113",

By replacing   「いる」   with   「ある」 , instead of a continuing action, it becomes a resultant state after the action has already taken place. Usually, this expression is used to explain that something is in a state of completion. The completed action also carries a nuance of being completed in preparation for something else. Since this grammar describes the state of a completed action, it is common to see the   「は」   and   「も」  particles instead of the   「を」   particle.  119",

Imagine this: you have made a delicious pie and you're going to   place   it on the window sill for it to cool so that you can eat it later. This image might help explain why the verb   「おく」   ( 置く ), meaning \"to place\", can be used to describe a preparation for the future. (It's just too bad that pies on window sills always seem to go through some kind of mishap especially in cartoons.) While   「置く」   by itself is written in kanji, it is customary to use hiragana when it comes attached to a conjugated verb (such as the te-form).  Examples",

The simple solution is to add a generic noun such as a generic event:  こと   ( 事 ) or an appearance/manner:   よう   ( 様 ). These nouns don't refer to anything specific and are used to describe something else. In this case, they allow us to describe verbs in the same manner as nouns.

However, while   「いけない」   can be used by itself,   「ならない」   must only be used in the grammar presented here. In addition, while   「い けない」   and   「ならない」   conjugate like i-adjectives they are not actual adjectives. Let's learn how to use these words to express things that must not be done. . . • Take the te-form of the verb, add the   「は」   (wa) particle and finally attach either   「だめ」、「い けない」、 or   「ならない」 .

Teachers are often reluctant to teach these overly familiar expressions because they are so much easier to use which is bad for times when they might not be appropriate. But, on the other hand, if you don't learn casual expressions, it makes it difficult to understand your friends (or would-be friends if you only knew how to speak less stiffly!). So here they are but take care to properly practice the longer forms so that you will be able to use them for the appropriate occasions. . .",

However, unlike most conjugations we learned where the verb turns into a ru-verb, this form actually transforms the verb into an i-adjective (notice how   「たい」   conveniently ends in   「い」 ). This makes sense because the conjugated form is a description of something that you want to do. Once you have the   「たい」   form, you can then conjugate it the same as you would any other i-adjective. However, the   「たい」   form is different from regular i-adjectives because it is derived from a verb. This means that all the particles we normally associate with verbs such as   「を」、「に」、「へ」 、 or   「で」   can all be used with the   「たい」   form, which is not true for regular i-adjectives. Here's a chart just for you.  「たい」   conjugations  Positive   Negative Non-Past   ⾏きたい   ⾏きたくない  Past   ⾏きたかった   ⾏きたくなかった  Examples",

This is done by simply enclosing the statement in quotes, adding   「と」   and then inserting the appropriate verb. The most common verbs associated with a direct quote would be  「⾔う」   and   「聞く」   but you may use any verbs related to direct quotation such as:   「叫ぶ」 ,   「呼ぶ」  ,   「呟く」 , etc. This type of quotation is often used for dialogue in novels and other narrative works.

If you guessed that this next grammar for attempting to do something would involve the volitional form, you were right. To say that you tried (as in attempted) to do something, you need to conjugate the verb into the volitional, enclose it in a quotation (so that we can perform an action on the clause) and finally add the verb   「する」 . Or put more simply, you just add   「とする」   to the volitional form of the verb. This is simply an extension of the quoted relative clause from the last section. Instead of saying the quote ( ⾔ う ) or treating it as a thought ( 思う、考える ), we are simply doing it with   「する」 . . . Change the verb to the volitional form and add   「とする」 . Examples",

    "meaning": "one day The year is very easy. All you have to do is say the number and add   「年」   which is pronounced here as   「ねん」   . For example, Year 2003 becomes 2003   年   ( にせんさんねん ). The catch is that there is another calendar which starts over every time a new emperor ascends the throne. The year is preceded by the era, for example the year 2000 is:   平成   12   年 . My birthday, 1981 is   昭和   56   年   (The Showa era lasted from 1926 to 1989). You may think that you don't need to know this but if you're going to be filling out forms in Japan, they often ask you for your birthday or the current date in the Japanese calendar ( 和 暦 ). So here's a neat converter you can use to convert to the Japanese calendar. Saying the months is actually easier than English because all you have to do is write the number (either in numerals or kanji) of the month and add   「⽉」   which is read as   「がつ」 . However, you need to pay attention to April ( ４⽉ ), July ( ７⽉ ), and September ( ９⽉ ) which are pronounced   「しがつ」、 「しち がつ」、 and   「くがつ」   respectively. Finally, we get to the days of the month, which is where the headache starts. The first day of the month is  「ついたち」 ( ⼀⽇ );   different   from 「いちにち」   ( ⼀⽇ ), which means \"one day\". Besides this and some other exceptions we'll soon cover, you can simply say the number and add   「⽇」   which is pronounced here as   「にち」 . For example, the 26th becomes 26   ⽇   ( にじゅうろくにち ). Pretty simple,   however , the first 10 days, the 14th, 19th, 20th, 29th have special readings that you must separately memorize. If you like memorizing things, you'll have a ball here. Notice that the kanji doesn't change but the reading does.  187",

    "meaning": "next to  「じゃん」   is an abbreviation of   「じゃない」 , the negative conjugation for nouns and na-adjectives. However, this only applies to   「じゃない」   used in the following fashion. •   サラリーマンだから、残業はたくさんするんじゃない？  Because he ʼ s a salaryman, doesn ʼ t he do a lot of overtime? The important thing to note about the example above is that   「じゃない」   here is actually confirming the positive. In fact, a closer translation is,   “ Because he ʼ s a salaryman, he   probably does   a lot of overtime. ”  But it ʼ s still a question so there ʼ s a slight nuance that you are seeking confirmation even though you are relatively sure.  「じゃん」   is a shorter slang for expressing the same type of thing except it doesn ʼ t even bother to ask a question to confirm. It ʼ s completely affirmative in tone. In fact, the closest equivalent to   「じゃん」   is   「じゃない」   used in the following fashion. •   まあ、いいじゃない。  Well, it ʼ s probably fine (don ʼ t you think?). This type of expression is the   only   case where you can attach   「じゃない」   directly to i-adjectives and verbs. Once you actually hear this expression in real life, you ʼ ll see that it has a distinct pronunciation that is different from simply using the negative. Plus, you have to realize that this type of   「じゃない」  sounds rather mature and feminine, unlike   「じゃん」 , which is gender-neutral. Like the above, specialized use of   「じゃない」 , you can also attach   「じゃん」   directly to verbs and i-adjectives as well as the usual nouns and na-adjectives.   Because slang is usually created to make things easier, it ʼ s not surprising that the rules for using   「じゃん」   are so lax and easy.  196",

It is used all the time and therefore, it's not too surprising that a number of variations and slang have developed. Here's one more that I felt was too \"slangy\" to cover so early at that point of the guide. This may sound hard to believe but if you really slur 「という」 together, it becomes something resembling  「つ」 . Or least, that's what somebody thought when he or she began replacing   「という」   with   「つ」  or in some case   「つう」 . Now, in my opinion,   「つ」   is a lot harder to say than   「という」   so using it like a native might take a bit of practice. Rather than making things easier to say, as is usually the case, the real purpose of this substitution is to sound rougher because   「つ」   has a harder, hissing sound.   This is ideal for when you're pissed or for that young and rough image you've always wanted. As you might expect, this type of speech is usually used by males or very tough females.  Examples",

In the case of   「何か」 , while   「なにか」   is the correct reading, it is often contracted to just   「なんか」   in casual speech. •   なにか⾷べる？  Eat something? •   なんか⾷べる？  Eat something? However,   「なんか」   also has a function similar to the word \"like\" in English. By \"like\", I'm not talking about the actual word but the kind that has no meaning and some people use just about anywhere in the sentence. Similarly,   「なんか」   can also be used as a filler without any actual meaning. For instance, take a look at the example below. •   今⽇は、なんか忙しいみたいよ。  I guess he's like busy today. While   「なんか」   is a shorter version of   「なにか」 , only   「なんか」   can be used in this way as a filler. •   今⽇は、なにか忙しいみたいよ。  ( 「なにか」   cannot be used as a filler word.)

Of course, that doesn't mean it's necessarily a very sophisticated manner of speech but just like using \"like\" all the time, I cannot deny that it is an easy habit to fall into. In that sense, due to its over-use, it has almost lost any specific meaning. You may overhear a conversation like the following:  Ａ：あのさ・ ・ ・  A: Hey...  Ｂ：うん。  B: Yeah.  Ａ：この間さ・ ・ ・  A: This one time...  Ｂ：うん。  B: Yeah.  Ａ：ディズニーランドに⾏ったんだけどさ、なんかさ、すごい込んでて・ ・ ・  A: I went to Disney Land and it was really crowded...  Ｂ：うん  B: Uh huh.  Ａ：何もできなくてさ・ ・ ・  A: Couldn't do anything, you know... And it goes on like this, sometimes the other person might break in to say something related to the topic. You can use   「な」   in place of   「ね」   when it sounds too soft and reserved for what you want to say or for the audience you are speaking to. Its rough sound generally applies to the male gender but is not necessarily restricted to only males.  203",

Like Captain Picard so succinctly puts it, the causative verb means to \"make it so\". This verb is usually used in the context of making somebody do something. The really confusing thing about the causative verb is that it can also mean to   let   someone do something. Or maybe this is a different type of verb with the exact same conjugation rules. Whichever the case may be, a verb in the causative form can mean either making or letting someone do something. The only good news is that when the causative form is used with   「あげる」   and   「くれる」 , it almost always means to \"let someone do\". Once you get used to it, surprisingly, it becomes quite clear which meaning is being used when.",

It is neither honorific nor humble but it is a step above   「あ る」   in politeness. However, unless you want to sound like a samurai,   「ござる」   is always used in the polite form:   「ございます」 . By extension, the politer version of   「です」   is   「でございます」   . This is essentially the masu-form conjugation of   「でござる」 , which comes from   「である」   literally meaning, \"to exist as\" (to be covered much later).  Examples",

    "meaning": "to do (humble) For all other verbs without set expressions, there are conjugation rules to change them into honorific and humble forms. They both involve a common practice of attaching a polite prefix   「御」   . In Japanese, there is an practice of attaching an honorific prefix   「御」   to certain (not all) nouns to show politeness. In fact, some words like   「お酒」、 「お茶」、 or   「お⾦」   come with this prefix so often that it's become practically the word itself. In general,   「御」   is written in hiragana as either   「ご」   for words read as   ⾳ 読み   (e.g.   ご意⾒、ご飯 ) or   「お」   for words read as   訓読み   (e.g.   お⾦、 お仕事 ). In fact, you may have been using this prefix already without realizing it like   「お好み焼き」   or   「お⼟産」   . There are some exceptions to this rule such as   「お返事」 . Luckily since   「御」   is rarely written in kanji, identifying the exceptions should not really be a problem.  Honorific Form  The honorific form of verbs   that are not among the set honorific expressions given above   can be formed in two different ways.  228",

However, unlike   「だけ」 , which is used in regular conversations,   「のみ」   is usually only used in a written context. It is often used for explaining policies, in manuals, and other things of that nature. This grammar really belongs in the advanced section since formal language has a different flavor and tone from what we have seen so far. However, it is covered here because it is essentially identical to   「だけ」 . Just googling for  「のみ」   will quickly show the difference in the type of language that is used with   「のみ」   as opposed to  「だけ」 .",

Notice this is fundamentally different from   「しか」   which expresses a   lack   of everything else but the item in question. In more casual situations,   「ばかり」   is usually pronounced   「ばっかり」  or just   「ばっか」 . For example, let's say you went to a party to find, much to your dismay, the whole room filled with middle-aged women. You might say the following. •   何だよ！おばさんばっかりじゃないか？  What the? Isn't it nothing but obasan? Or perhaps a little more girly: •   いやだ。おばさんばっかり。  Eww. It's nothing but obasan.  Examples  •   崇君は漫画ばっかり読んでてさ。かっこ悪い。  Takashi-kun is reading nothing but comic books... He's so uncool. It is quite common in casual speech to end midsentence like this. Notice   「読んでて」   is the te-form of  「読んでいる」   with the   「い」   dropped.

Instead of looking at the height, we can even attach   「さ」   to the adjective for \"low\" to focus on the amount of lowness as opposed to the amount of highness. In fact, there is nothing to stop us from using this with any adjective to indicate an amount of that adjective. The result becomes a regular noun indicating the amount of that adjective. . . •   For i-adjectives : First remove the trailing   「い」   from the i-adjective and then attach   「さ」",

It can mean similarity in appearance, similarity in behavior or even that current evidence points to a likely outcome. We will now learn how to say the third meaning: how to indicate a likely outcome given the situation. Just like the grammar we have learned so far in this lesson, we can use this grammar by simply attaching  「そう」   to the end of verbs, and adjectives. However, there are four important different cases. Actually, I just noticed this but the conjugation rules are exactly the same as the   「〜すぎる」   grammar we learned in the last section. The only difference is that for the adjective   「いい」 , you need to change it to   「よさ」  before attaching   「そう」   to create   「よさそう」 .  262",

Unlike the last grammar we learned, you can simply attach   「そうだ」   to verbs and i-adjectives. For na-adjectives and nouns, you must indicate the state-of-being by adding   「だ」   to the noun/na-adjective. Also, notice that   「そう」   itself must always end in   「だ」、「です」、 or   「でございます」 .

As a result, you can also add a voiced version   「〜がたい」   as a verb suffix to express the same thing as   「にく い」 .   「にくい」   is more common for speaking while   「がたい」   is more suited for the written medium.  「にくい」   tends to be used for physical actions while   「がたい」   is usually reserved for less physical actions that don't actually require movement. However, there seems to be no hard rule on which is more appropriate for a given verb so I suggest searching for both versions in google to ascertain the popularity of a given combination. You should also always write the suffix in hiragana to prevent ambiguities in the reading.  277",

For instance, the sentence \"I didn't eat, and then I went to sleep\" would become 「⾷ べなくて寝た。 」   However, this sentence sounds a bit strange because eating doesn't have much to do with sleeping. What we probably   really   want to say is that we went to sleep   without   eating. To express this, we need to use a more generalized form of the negative request we covered at the very end of the giving and receiving lesson. In other words, instead of substituting the last   「い」   with   「くて」 , we need only append   「で」   instead.  279",

However, you can't directly modify other words in this form; in other words, you can't make it a modifying relative clause. In the same manner as before,   「する」 becomes 「せん」   and 「くる」   becomes 「こん」   though I've never heard or seen   「こ ん」   actually being used. If you have ever heard   ｢すまん」   and wondered what that meant, it's actually an example of this grammar. Notice that   「すみません」   is actually in polite negative form. Well, the plain form would be   「すまない」 , right? That further transforms to just   「すまん」 . The word brings up an image of   おじさん   but that may be just me. Anyway, it's a male expression.  281",

While this version of the negative conjugation is old-fashioned and part of classical Japanese, you will still encounter it occasionally. In fact, I just saw this conjugation on a sign at the train station today, so it's not too uncommon. For any verb, you can replace   「ない」   with   「ぬ」   to get to an old-fashion sounding version of the negative. Similar to the last section,   「する」   becomes   「せぬ」   and   「くる」   becomes   「こぬ」 . You may hear this grammar being used from older people or your friends if they want to bring back ye olde days. . . • An old-fashioned way to say a negative verb is to use   「ぬ」   instead of   「ない」 .

In a previous lesson, we learn how to combine the volitional form with  「とする」   to indicate an attempt to perform an action. We will now learn several other ways   「とする」  can be used. It may help to keep in mind that   「とする」   is really just a combination of the quotation particle   「と」   and the verb   「する」   meaning \"to do\". Let's say you have a sentence: [verb] とする . This means literally that you are doing like \"[verb]\" (in quotes). As you can see, when used with the volitional, it becomes: \"Doing like making motion to do [verb]\". In other words, you are acting as if to make a motion to do [verb]. As we have already seen, this translates to \"attempt to do [verb]\". Let's see what happens when we use it on plain verbs.  Examples  •   明⽇に⾏くとする。  Assume we go tomorrow. The example above is considering what would happen supposing that they should decide to go tomorrow. You can see that the literal translation \"do like we go tomorrow\" still makes sense.   However, in this situation, we are making a hypothesis unlike the grammar we have gone over before with the volitional form of the verb. Since we are considering a hypothesis, it is reasonable to assume that the conditional will be very handy here and indeed, you will often see sentences like the following:  287",

    "meaning": "to wake; to occur This is a very useful grammar that is used to indicate that one has just finished doing something. For instance, the first time I really wished I knew how to say something like this was when I wanted to politely decline an invitation to eat because I had just eaten. To do this, take the past tense of verb that you want to indicate as just being completed and add   「ばかり」 . This is used with only the past tense of verbs and is not to be confused with the   「ばかり」   used with nouns to express amounts. Just like the other type of   「ばかり」   we have covered before, in slang, you can hear people use   「ばっ か」   instead of   「ばかり」 . . . • To indicate that an action has ended just recently, take the past tense of the verb and add   「ばか り」 . Example:   ⾷べる   →   ⾷べた   →   ⾷べたばかり  • For casual speech, you can abbreviate   「ばかり」   to just   「ばっか」  Example:   ⾷べたばかり   →   ⾷べたばっか  You can treat the result as you would with any noun.  Positive   Negative  ⾷べたばかり   ( だ )   Just ate   ⾷べたばかりじゃない   Didn't just eat . Using   「ばかり」 for actions just completed  Examples",

In other words, you can use it with nouns or adjectives to talk about what something is while something else. The implied state-of-being means that you must not use the declarative   「だ」   , you just attach   「ながら」   to the noun or adjective. For example, a common way this grammar is used is to say, \"While it's unfortunate, something something...\" In Japanese, this would become   「残念ながら・ ・ ・ 」  You can also attach the inclusive   「も」   particle to   「ながら」   to get   「ながらも」 . This changes the meaning from \"while\" to \"even while\". . . • To say [X] is something while something else, attach   「ながら」   to [X] Example  残念   →   残念ながら  • To say [X] is something even while something else, attach   「ながらも」   to [X] Example  貧乏   →   貧乏ながらも  .

You can treat   「はず」   just like a regular noun as it is usually attached to the adjective or verb that is supposed to be or supposed to happen. The only thing to be careful about here is expressing an expectation of something   not   happening. To do this, you must use the negative existence verb   「ない」   to say that such an expectation does not exist. This might be in the form of   「〜はずがない」   or   「〜はずはない」   depending on which particle you want to use. The negative conjugation   「はずじゃない」   is really only used when you want to confirm in a positive sense such as   「〜はずじゃないか？ 」 .  305",

    "meaning": "newspaper  「べき」 is a verb suffix used to describe something that is supposed to be done. This suffix is commonly defined as \"should\", however, one must realize that it cannot be used to make suggestions like the sentence, \"You should go to the doctor.\" If you use   「べき」 , it sounds more like, \"You are supposed to go to the doctor.\" 「べき」 has a much stronger tone and makes you sound like a know-it-all telling people what to do. For making suggestions, it is customary to use the comparison 「⽅がいい」 grammar instead. For this reason, this grammar is almost never used to directly tell someone what to do. It is usually used in reference to oneself where you can be as bossy as you want or in a neutral context where circumstances dictate what is proper and what is not. One such example would be a sentence like, \"We are supposed to raise our kids properly with a good education.\" Unlike the   「はず」   grammar, there is no expectation that something is going to happen. Rather, this grammar describes what one should do in a given circumstance. In Japanese, you might define it as meaning   「絶対ではないが、強く推奨されている」 . There is very little of grammatical interest.   「べき」   works just like a regular noun and so you can conjugate it as   「べきじゃない」、「べきだった」 , and so on. The only thing to note here is that when you're using it with   「する」 , the verb meaning \"to do\", you can optionally drop the   「る」   from   「するべ き」   to produce   「すべき」 . You can do this with this verb only and it does not apply for any other verbs even if the verb is written as   「する」   such as   「擦る」 , the verb meaning \"to rub\". . .

However, what needs mentioning here is that by changing it into a conjunctive and adding a predicate, the meaning of   「べく」   changes from the ordinary meaning of   「べき」 . While  「べき」   describes a strong suggestion, changing it to   「べく」   allows you to describe what one did in order to carry out that suggestion. Take a look that the following examples to see how the meaning changes.",

However, it seems to be a conjugation of an old   未然 形   of   「べから」 . I have no idea what that means and you don't have to either. The only thing we need to take away from this is that   「べからず」   expresses the opposite meaning of   「べき」   as an action that one must   not   do. I suppose the short and abrupt ending of the   「ず」   form makes this more useful for laying out rules. In fact, searching around on google comes up with a bunch of   「べし ･ ベからず」   or \"do's and don'ts\". ( べし   is an older form of   べき , which I doubt you'll ever need.) . .

Therefore, you would not use it for your own emotions since guessing about your own emotions is not necessary. This grammar can only be used with adjectives so you can use this grammar to say, \"He is acting scared,\" but you cannot say \"He acted surprised,\" because \"to be surprised\" is a verb in Japanese and not an adjective. This grammar is also commonly used with a certain set of adjectives related to emotions such as:   「嫌」、「怖い」、「嬉し い」、 or   「恥ずかしい」 .  318",

It is the negative version of the grammar we previously covered for something that has to be done. It uses the negative of the verb   「得る」   or \"obtain\", to roughly mean that \"one cannot obtain not doing of an action\". This means that you can't not do something even if you wanted to.   As a result of the use of double negatives, this grammar carries a slight suggestion that you really don't want to do it, but you have to because it can't be helped. Really, the negative connotation is the only difference between this grammar and the grammar we covered in this \"have to\" section. That, and the fact that this grammar is fancier and more advanced.  324",

    "meaning": "situation This grammar is very similar to the one we just learned above except that it uses the verb   「⽌む」   to say that one cannot obtain the stopping of something. Remember that we normally can't just attach the  「を」   direct object particle to verbs, so this is really a set expression. Just like the previous grammar we learned, it is used to describe something that one is forced to do due to some circumstances. The difference here is that this is a complete phrase, which can be used for a general situation that doesn't involve any specific action. In other words, you're not actually forced to   do   something; rather it describes a situation that cannot be helped. If you have already learned   「仕⽅がない」   or   「しょうがない」 , this grammar means pretty much the same thing. The difference lies in whether you want to say, \"Looks like we're stuck\" vs \"Due to circumstances beyond our control...\" Since this is a set expression, there are really no grammar points to discuss. You only need to take the phrase and use it as you would any regular relative clause.  Examples",

While much of this is a repetition of what's written there,   「かねる」   is a ru-verb that is used as a suffix to other verbs to express a person's inability, reluctance, or refusal to do something  「かねる」   is often used in the negative as   「かねない」   to indicate that there is a possibility that the verb in question might happen. As the jeKai entry mentions, this is usually in reference to something bad, which you might express in English as, \"there is a risk that...\" or \"there is a fear that...\" One important thing that the jeKai doesn't mention is how you would go about using this grammar. It's not difficult and you may have already guessed from the example sentences that all you need to do is just attach   「かねる」   or   「かねない」   to the stem of the verb.  327",

In fact, it's so rare that I only found one explanation in English on the web or anywhere else. (I also found this one in Japanese.) The negative volitional is used to express negative intention. This means that there is a will for something to   not   happen or that someone is set out to   not   do something. As a result, because one is trying not to do something, it's probably not going to happen. Essentially, it is a very stiff and formal version of   「で  335",

You can think of this grammar as a very old-fashioned version for i-adjectives and negative   「い」   endings. The conjugation rule is simple: remove the last 「い」 and attach 「かろう」 .

It is also another type of grammar that is not really used in regular conversational Japanese.  「否」   (read here as   「いな」 ) is a Kanji meaning \"no\" used in words like   「否定」 . The literal meaning of this grammar is \"whether the action was taken or not\". In order words, the second action is taken before you even take the time to determine whether the first event really happened or not. You can use this grammar by attaching   「や」   or   「や否や」   to the dictionary form of the first verb that occurred. Since this grammar is used for events that already have occurred, the second verb is usually in the past tense.
